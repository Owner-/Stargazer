Stargazer 1.0 [http://www.princeton.edu/~wjia/stargazer]

Scripts in this directory should be used in conjunction with GPGPU-Sim
[http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~aamodt/gpgpu-sim/] v2.x
[https://dev.ece.ubc.ca/projects/gpgpu-sim/browser/v2.x].
They are meant to automate some parts of the data collection and sampling
process for Stargazer, if GPGPU-Sim is chosen to be used as the measurement
tool for exploring the GPU design space.

To use each script, set up GPGPU-Sim v2.x first. Then copy the scripts in this
directory to the directory containing each benchmark program in the GPGPU-Sim
source tree. Scripts can be executed in ways as Python scripts usually are. All
scripts are currently written assuming the default BlackScholes program in
GPGPU-Sim is being used, but users can change the beginning of each script to
adapt it to different benchmark programs.

As an example, if the user wants to run 100 simulations of BlackScholes with
varying parameters, here are the steps.

1. Set up GPGPU-Sim v2.x.
2. Copy simulate.py to $GPGPUSIM/benchmarks/CUDA/BlackScholes.
3. Modify the content of simulate.py so that nsample in line 51 equals 100.
4. Execute "python simulate.py" in the terminal.

Other scripts can be used in similar ways. More information about the usage of
each script can be found inside its source file.
