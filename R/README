Scripts in this directory demonstrate how to use R to complete some common
tasks. The scripts can be executed with the R "source" function. Because of the
symbolic links in this folder, R's work directory can be set to either this
directory or one level above.

All scripts are currently written assuming the default matrix.csv input file is
being used, but users can change the beginning of each script to adapt it to
different input CSV files.

As an example, to time the regression progress, here are the steps.

1. Edit time.R so that files in line 8 is a list of CSV fiels to test.
2. Execute "source('time.R')" in an R terminal.

Other scripts can be used in similar ways. More information about the usage of
each script can be found inside its source file.
