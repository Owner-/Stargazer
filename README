Stargazer is a regression-based GPU design space exploration tool. It can be
used to efficiently survey extremely large hardware and software design spaces
of modern GPUs.

2. matrix.csv: Example input file from simulating a matrix multiply program.
3. matrix-training.csv: 60% of the matrix.csv file, randomly selected.
4. matrix-test.csv: 40% of the matrix.csv file, randomly selected.
5. gpgpusim/README: Directions for how to use Python scripts in this folder.
6. gpgpusim/simulate.py: Run GPGPU-Sim multiple times with varying parameters.
7. gpgpusim/collect.py: Collect simulation results and generate CSV files.
8. gpgpusim/split.py: Split a CSV file into a traing set and a test set.
9. gpgpusim/filter.py: Scan a CSV file s.t. only lines w/ certain values remain.
